- 👋 Hi, I’m @rennil42 - 42 was not picked for my age
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things but the profile is primarily for EverQuest related things. I run EQ on Linux and therefore need a few tools to help facilitate this.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning things that will help me improve and/or create new tools.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on tools or utilities to improve the gaming experience on Linux.
- 📫 How to reach me - I haven't decided yet.
